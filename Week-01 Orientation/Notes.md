# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers, ensuring data security and transparency. It operates without a central authority, using cryptographic techniques to verify and add new transactions.

# Why Blockchains?

- **Inflating Currencies**: Central banks can print more money, leading to inflation.
- **Inflation Issues**: Printing money and distributing it to everyone causes inflation, reducing the value of money.
- **Random Bailouts**: Governments bail out failing institutions, creating unfair economic conditions.
- **Need for Better Currency**: A currency that is open, transparent, and immune to arbitrary printing is essential.
- **Fractional Reserve Banking**: Banks only keep a fraction of depositors' money on hand, which can lead to financial instability.
- **Currency Depreciation**: Traditional currencies lose value over time due to inflation.
- **Lack of Backing**: Modern currencies are not backed by tangible assets like gold or silver.

# Main Characteristics of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization**: Blockchain is managed across multiple nodes (machines), ensuring no single entity controls the data. Each node stores the entire blockchain, providing access to all data on the blockchain.
2. **Immutability**: Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be easily altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the records.
3. **Transparency**: All transactions recorded on a blockchain are visible to all participants, promoting openness and trust.
4. **Consensus Mechanisms**: Nodes in the network follow consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.

# Purpose of Blockchain

The purpose of blockchain is to create a network of computers that agree upon a common state of data. This ensures that:

- Any person or organization can participate in the process.
- No single person or organization can control the process.

Blockchain enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions without the need for a central authority.

# How to Create a New Currency with Blockchain

There is a need for trustless, anonymized, and decentralized forms of money. Blockchain solves this for us.

## Key Points

1. **Avoiding Central Ownership**:

   - Centralized control over currency can lead to misuse of power and lack of transparency.
   - Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a central authority, distributing control among multiple nodes.

2. **Trustless System**:

   - Blockchain enables the creation of currency without needing to trust a central authority.
   - Transactions are verified by consensus mechanisms, ensuring security and integrity.

3. **Anonymization**:

   - Blockchain technology supports anonymized transactions, protecting the privacy of users while maintaining transparency of the overall system.

4. **Decentralization**:
   - Decentralized money operates on a network of nodes, preventing any single entity from having control and reducing the risk of manipulation or failure.

# Hashing

Hashing transforms input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters.

### Properties

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same output.
2. **Fast Computation**: Hash value can be quickly verified for any data.
3. **Pre-image Resistance**: Difficult to reverse the hash function to find the original input.
4. **Small Changes in Input Produce Large Changes in Output**: Tiny input changes drastically alter the hash output.
5. **Collision Resistance**: Difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

### Example - SHA-256

- Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit: Produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from any input.

# Hashing vs. Encryption

## Hashing

- Converts data into a fixed-size string.
- Irreversible (one-way function).
- Used for data integrity verification (e.g., password storage, file verification).

## Encryption

- Converts data into a different format.
- Reversible (two-way function) using a key.
- Used for data confidentiality (e.g., securing communication, data storage).

# How Does Blockchain Work?

### Blocks

- Data is stored in "blocks."
- Each block contains:
  - A list of transactions.
  - A timestamp.
  - A cryptographic hash of the previous block.

### Chain

- Blocks are linked together in a chronological order.
- This creates a "chain" of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."

# Important Terms

## Nonce

- A unique number that miners must find to produce a valid hash.
- Used only once, it ensures the resulting hash satisfies the blockchain's difficulty conditions.

## Finding Nonce

### Miners and Compute Power

- Miners produce blocks in the blockchain.
- The probability of producing the next block and earning the reward increases with more compute power.
- Compute power is needed to calculate the correct nonce.

### Nonce and Proof of Work (PoW)

- The nonce is a number that, when added to the block data and hashed, produces a hash meeting the network's difficulty criteria.
- The process of finding this nonce is known as Proof of Work (PoW).

## Consensus Mechanism

- A method ensuring all participants agree on the blockchain's state and the validity of transactions.
- Acts as a rulebook for validating transactions and blocks.

## Proof of Work (PoW)

- A consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks.
- Requires solving complex mathematical problems to find the correct nonce.
- Ensures the security and integrity of the blockchain by validating transactions and adding new blocks.
